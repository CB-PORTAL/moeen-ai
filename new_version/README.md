# Moeen AI - Your Virtual Instruction Execution Assistant

Welcome to the Moeen AI project! Moeen is an AI-powered virtual assistant that can intelligently interpret natural language instructions and autonomously execute them, streamlining your workflows and boosting productivity.

## Project Vision

The goal of Moeen AI is to provide a seamless way for users to translate written instructions into executable actions, all with a simple highlight and right-click. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) and browser automation, Moeen aims to be your go-to tool for automating repetitive tasks and navigating complex workflows.

## Key Features (MVP)

- **Instruction Parsing**: Highlight text instructions on any webpage and have Moeen analyze and understand the steps involved.
- **Intelligent Execution**: With a single click, Moeen will autonomously carry out the instructions, navigating websites, filling forms, and interacting with page elements as needed.  
- **Chrome Extension**: Moeen will be conveniently accessible right from your browser toolbar, ready to assist whenever you need it.
- **Workflow Automation**: From troubleshooting software issues to drafting emails, let Moeen handle the grunt work while you focus on the bigger picture.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python - for its rich ecosystem of AI/ML and automation libraries
- **NLP**: spaCy - powerful, production-ready library for understanding and processing text
- **Browser Automation**: Puppeteer - flexible and user-friendly tool for controlling Chrome programmatically 
- **UI**: React - to build an intuitive and responsive frontend for the Chrome extension
